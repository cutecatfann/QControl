    <p><strong>Type of SQL Object: </strong>Trigger</p>
    <p><strong>Description: </strong> There are three triggers that fire to keep track of all changes to users in the database. One fires on insertion, one on Updates, and one on Deletes. They all feed into an audit table that will keep track of the change, the time of change, who did the change. Click one of the below buttons to edit the users in the database. </p>
    <p><strong>Justification: </strong> This will help keep track of changes to the user table, and in the real world, would be a security measure. These triggers provide an audit log for keeping track of what is happening in the user table. This would be useful if someone is trying to raise their own permissions, delete someone who should not be deleted, ect.</p>
    <p><strong>All of the trigger code is hardened to SQL injections.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Future Work: </strong>Currently, the password is not being stored in a secure way. Since this is a test database where the user's personal information does not need to be heavility protected, this is OK. However, the security needs to be improved.</p>
